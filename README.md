# AndroidSpringAnimationDemo
Sample code for physics based spring animation in Android

With Android O (Preview), physics based animations are now available to developers! This project provides demo for Spring animation.

## Usage

Spring animation is driven by spring force which has two primary properties:
1) Damping
2) Stiffness

The velocity of the animation will be drive by these two parameters. With that said. A start velocity needs to be given to start the animation. This can either be fixed or calculated from gesture motion of the user.

## Fixed Velocity
In this demo, a fixed start velocity is defined. And the three bots have in been assigned different damping ratios but same stiffness level.

###High Bounce and Low Stiffness

###Middle Bot: Medium Bounce and Low Stiffness

###Right Both Low Bounce and Low Stiffness

## Gesture Driven Start velocity
