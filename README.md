# Android Spring Animation Demo
Android Spring Animation Sample for physics-based dynamic spring animations.

With Android O (Preview), physics-based animations are now available to developers! This project provides demo for Android Spring Animation.

## Usage

Spring animation is driven by spring force which has two primary properties:
1) Damping
2) Stiffness

The velocity of the animation will be drive by these two parameters. With that said. A start velocity needs to be given to start the animation. This can either be fixed or calculated from gesture motion of the user.

## Fixed Velocity Spring Animation
In this demo, a fixed start velocity for spring animation is pre-defined. And the three objects have in been assigned different damping ratios but same stiffness level.

### High Bounce and Low Stiffness
